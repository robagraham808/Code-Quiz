As a coding student

I will create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundementals that saves high scores

I want to be able to see my progress compared to my peers in class

Guidlines are as follows: 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
Mock-Up
